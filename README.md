# Workout Form Assessment - Backend

This repository contains the backend code for the Workout Form Assessment project, developed as a part of a Project-Based Learning (PBL) initiative in Computer Engineering.

## Project Overview

The Workout Form Assessment project aims to provide real-time feedback on workout forms using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The backend serves as the core processing unit, handling data storage, model inference, and communication with the frontend.

## Features

- **Model Inference:** Utilizes machine learning models to assess workout form based on video input.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Provides immediate feedback on workout forms using real-time video processing.
- **Data Storage:** Stores user data securely and efficiently.
- **API Endpoints:** Provides endpoints for communication with the frontend application.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Docker
- Nodemon
